# Learn C language : Comments

- Comments are nothing but notes we write in program to describe 
  what it intend to do. So it is type of documentation.
- Comments are not threated as program and will be ignored by the compiler.

**In C, we have 2 types of comments**
- Single line comments 
- Multi-line comments

## Example
``` c 
// Example of single line comment. Single line comment start with "//" and
// it will be effective till end of that line.
int main() { // Main is a entry point of c program.

    /* Example of multi-line comment. 
    Main is a function, which return 
    int value 0 or 1.
    */
}
```
